AspMvcIdentity
==============

User interface to create ASP.NET Identity Roles, Users, Claims etc

By default ASP.NET MVC default template doesn't provide user interface to 

1. create new role
2. update role
3. add user to a particular role
4. remove user from a particular role
5. delete a role
6. etc.

This project provides user interface that gives above functionality to the end user (administrator).

This is completely open source. Feel free to download and use in commercial application. If you give credit to this project url that would be nice otherwise also its fine.
